This code is using C++ language.
To run the code required input of the maximum different ways of coins can be separated into piles (N_max) which we desire.
Output is the least value of coins (n) which p(n) is divisible by N_max.

Several test cases:
Input: N_max = 1000000
Output: n = 55374

Input: N_max = 7
Output: n = 5

Input: N_max = 10
Output: n = 9

Input: N_max = 150
Output: n = 124

Input: N_max = 5000
Output: n = 599

Input: N_max = 1200000
Output: n = 104749

Input: N_max = 1700000
Output: n = 131699
