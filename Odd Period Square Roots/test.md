This code is using C++ language.
To run the code required input of the maximum number (N) which we desire.
Output is total continued fractions until N which have an odd period (OddPeriod).

Several test cases:
Input: N = 10000
Output: OddPeriod = 1322

Input: N = 13
Output: OddPeriod = 4

Input: N = 23
Output: OddPeriod = 5

Input: N = 50
Output: OddPeriod = 10

Input: N = 110
Output: OddPeriod = 23

Input: N = 20000
Output: OddPeriod = 2524

Input: N = 35000
Output: OddPeriod = 4252
